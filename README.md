# BlackJackV2
This is a further refined and more functional piece of code. I hope to make some more additions and features in future.
This code now has the functionality to play the game normally using just Hit and Stand.
Additional features include proper chip return and the ability to double down on bets.
Future additions:
  Split hand
  Account based system
  Possible GUI(not a priority)
